The file CoAxial_PPT is the main file with the ODE solver. The other files are functions for various models, the resistance model as example. 
Which could be improved upon, hence its seperate file designation. 
The QRCharger file is a script to analyse the performance of the QRCharging method discussed in the paper. It is seperate to the thruster head modelling.
